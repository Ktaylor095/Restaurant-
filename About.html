  <p>About Us</p>
  <p>A group of college teens were missing moms good ole cook'n and decided to start a resturant that provided all of moms favorite food. We serve up all of the food that mom used to cook in the kitchen. We take recipes to better serve out customers so that you don't miss any meal of the day.</p>
